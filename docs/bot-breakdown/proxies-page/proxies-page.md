# Proxies Page

The proxies page is where you set up proxies. The bot uses these proxies to avoid ip bans and bot protection blocking. 

Proxies aren't required to run the bot


Input your proxies line by line in the text field. Put the name of your proxy list in the list name input and click save.

Both ip:port and ip:port:user:pass proxies are supported

To edit a proxy list, choose it in the load list box, make changes, and then click save.
